# Task Management: Keep It Stupid Simple (KISS)

## Why?

Task management should not be a complicated endeavor. Every timeframe can be broken up into seperate tasks. These tasks can be broken up into smaller tasks. This process can continue until the task is small enough to be completed in a single sitting. This is the core of the KISS method. This method is not new, but it is often overlooked.
